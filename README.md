  -  🧠 Structs and how to store and organize multiple types of data

  - 🧼 Handling user input with fgets() and removing newlines for clean strings

  - 🧩 Modular code structure using src, include, and bin folders

  - 🗃️ Working with arrays of structs to manage book data

  - 💬 Condition logic for decision making (rule pass/fail system)

  - 💻 Console UI output formatting for clean and user-friendly interaction

  - 🧪 Building and testing C applications using manual test cases
